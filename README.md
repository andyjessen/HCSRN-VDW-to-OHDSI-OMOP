# HCSRN-VDW-to-OHDSI-OMOP
This project translates data from an HCSRN-VDW into an OHDSI-OMOP common data model using SAS.

## Prerequisites
### An HCSRN VDW Common Data Model
- Find information on how to become a member in [The Book of OHDSI](https://ohdsi.github.io/TheBookOfOhdsi/WhereToBegin.html).

### The ability to download the OHDSI OMOP Vocabulary files
- If you can connect with OHDSI OMOP Vocabulary by going to [Athena](https://athena.ohdsi.org/vocabulary/list) then you have the ability to get OHDSI OMOP Vocabulary data.

## Implementation Directions
1. Clone HCSRN-VDW-to-OHDSI-OMOP
2. Clone OHDSI Common Data Model
3. Download OHDSI OMOP Vocabulary from Athena
4. Edit Runtime Parameter Variables
5.
